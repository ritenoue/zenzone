                        <h4>Peaceful</h4>
                        <p>
                            According to Psychology Today, there are four kinds of peace: the peace of ease, tranquility, 
                            awareness, and of what's unchanging. These are good to know for understanding where your feelings 
                            are coming from and how to enjoy it even more. For more information, visit the 
                            <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-wise-brain/201611/what-is-your-sense-peace ">link</a>.

                        <h4>Happy</h4>
                        <p>
                            Since you're feeling happy, now would be a good time to reach out to a friend who seems down in the 
                            dumps. Reaching out when you're in a good place means that your energy won't be drained and you'll feel 
                            a lot better helping a friend out. Be the person you want to have the next time you're having a rough day.

                        <p>
                            When feeling content, it's a great time to go on a walk and start practicing gratitude for the things 
                            in your life. This will give you time to clear your head so you can focus on the things that matter most to 
                            you, and get some exercise while you're at it! To find hiking trails near you, check out
