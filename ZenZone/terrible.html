                        <h4>Depressed</h4>
                        <p>
                            Feeling depressed is often very isolating and difficult to overcome. Some good ways to cope with 
                            this feeling include taking small steps throughout the day, recognizing when you need a break, and 
                            reaching out to friends. For more resources, visit this

                        <h4>Irritable</h4>
                        <p>
                            Irritability can be a difficult feeling to shake and often leaves you feeling separated from those around you. 
                            Sometimes, you don't even recognize you're acting differently, but other times you're completely aware but nothing 
                            seems to help shake this feeling. Some helpful tips include taking a mental break, exercising, venting, 
                            disconnecting from your phone, or taking a nap. For more resources, visit this

                        <h4>Exausted</h4>
                        <p>
                            Being terrified or scared at any point in time can be a difficult emotion to cope with. 
                            Some good tips of getting through this include mental distractions such as playing a game or 
                            watching TV, writing out your thoughts or going on a walk. For more advice on how to handle

                            Steps to take:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes, you feel exhausted and it's difficult to know your limits and how to get through the day. 
                            Be sure to acknowledge when you're feeling exhausted, and be sure to take breaks when you feel it setting in. 
                            Engaging in non-work activities such as hobbies is another great way to change the focus of your energy.
